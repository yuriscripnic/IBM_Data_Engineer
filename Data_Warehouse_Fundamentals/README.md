# Practice Project: Introduction to Data Warehousing

## Scenario

You are a data engineer hired by a consumer electronics retail company. The company sells various electronic products through its online and offline channels across major cities in the United States. They operate multiple stores and warehouses to manage their inventory and sales operations. The company wants to create a data warehouse to analyze its sales performance and inventory management and aim to generate reports, such as:

- Total sales revenue per year per city
- Total sales revenue per month per city
- Total sales revenue per quarter per city
- Total sales revenue per year per product category
- Total sales revenue per product category per city
- Total sales revenue per product category per store

## Objectives
- Develop dimension and fact tables to organize and structure data effectively for analysis
- Employ SQL queries to create and load data into dimension and fact tables
- Create materialized views to optimize query performance



## Exercise 1: Design a data warehouse
| Sales ID   | Product Type | Price Per Unit    | Quantity Sold |City | Date    |
|:-----------| :------- | :--------    | :------ | :----- | :-----  |
|001|	Electronics|	$299.99|	30|	New York|	2024-04-01|
|002|	Apparel|	$49.99|	50|	Los Angeles|	2024-04-01|
|003|	Furniture|	$399.99|	10|	Chicago|	2024-04-02|
|004 |	Electronics |	$199.99|	20|	Houston|	2024-04-02|
|005|	Groceries|	$2.99|	100|	Miami|	2024-04-03|



## Task 1: Design the dimension table MyDimDateTask 1 - Design the dimension table MyDimDate
Write down the fields in the MyDimDate table in any text editor, one field per line. The company is looking at a granularity of day, which means they would like to have the ability to generate the report on a yearly, monthly, daily, and weekday basis.
Here is a partial list of fields to serve as an example:

dateid
month
monthname
â€¦

### Solution
Fields in MyDimDate table:

dateid
year
month
monthname
day
weekday
weekdayname
The table will have a unique identifier (dateid) for each date entry. Other fields such as year, month, monthname, day, weekday, and weekdayname will provide detailed information about each date, allowing for flexible reporting options based on different time intervals.

## Task 2: Design the dimension table MyDimProduct
Write down the fields in the MyDimProduct table in any text editor, one field per line.

### Solution:
In this task, you will design the dimension table MyDimProduct to store product-related information.

Fields in MyDimProduct table:

productid
productname
The table will have a unique identifier (productid) for each product entry. The field productname will store the name or description of the product. This table will facilitate analysis and reporting based on different products sold.

## Task 3: Design the dimension table MyDimCustomerSegment
Write down the fields in the MyDimCustomerSegment table in any text editor, one field per line.

### Solution:
In this task, you will design the dimension table MyDimCustomerSegment to store customer segment-related information.

Fields in DimCustomerSegment table:

segmentid
segmentname
## Task 4: Design the fact table MyFactSales
Write down the fields in the MyFactSales table in any text editor, one field per line.

### Solution:
In this task, you will design the fact table MyFactSales to store sales-related information.

Fields in FactSales table:

salesid
productid
quantitysold
priceperunit
segmentid
dateid

------
The fact table FactSales will store information about each sales transaction, including the unique identifier (salesid), product identifier (productid), quantity sold (quantitysold), price per unit (priceperunit), customer segment identifier (segmentid) and date identifier (dateid). This table will serve as the central repository for sales data and enable analysis and reporting on various dimensions
